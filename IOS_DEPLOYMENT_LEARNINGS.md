# iOS Deployment Learnings - January 2026

This document captures critical learnings from successful iOS deployment of the Carousel app using Codemagic CI/CD.

## Executive Summary

After resolving multiple code signing, build configuration, and asset issues, we successfully deployed an iOS app to App Store Connect. This document provides a roadmap to avoid the same pitfalls.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Code Signing Conflicts (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Mixed automatic/manual signing caused "Cannot save Signing Certificates without certificate private key" errors.

**Root Cause:** Having `ios_signing` block in the workflow's `environment` section conflicts with manual `fetch-signing-files` commands.

**Solution:** Remove `ios_signing` block entirely.

```yaml
# BEFORE (Broken)
environment:
  ios_signing:
    distribution_type: app_store
    bundle_identifier: "ai.carouselcards.app"
  vars:
    BUNDLE_ID: "ai.carouselcards.app"

# AFTER (Working)
environment:
  vars:
    BUNDLE_ID: "ai.carouselcards.app"
  node: 22
  xcode: latest
```

### 2. Apple Certificate Limit

**Problem:** Apple limits each team to 2 distribution certificates. Generating new certificates on every build hits limit quickly.

**Solution:** Generate certificate private key once and reuse across all apps.

**Implementation:**

1. **Generate key locally (one time):**
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out cert_key.pem 2048
   cat cert_key.pem | base64
   ```

2. **Store in Codemagic:**
   - Team Settings > Environment Variables
   - Variable name: `FCI_CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Value: Paste base64 output
   - Mark as secure

3. **Use in workflow:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Fetch signing files
     script: |
       set -exo pipefail
       CERT_KEY_PATH="$CM_BUILD_DIR/cert_key.pem"

       if [ -n "${FCI_CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY:-}" ]; then
         echo "$FCI_CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY" | base64 -d > "$CERT_KEY_PATH"
       else
         openssl genrsa -out "$CERT_KEY_PATH" 2048
         echo "⚠️ SAVE THIS AS FCI_CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY:"
         cat "$CERT_KEY_PATH" | base64
       fi

       app-store-connect fetch-signing-files "$BUNDLE_ID" \
         --type IOS_APP_STORE \
         --create \
         --certificate-key=@file:"$CERT_KEY_PATH"
   ```

**Key Points:**
- One certificate works for ALL apps under your Apple Developer team
- Only provisioning profiles are app-specific
- Must use `@file:` syntax, NOT `@env:`
- Store at team level for reuse across projects

---

### 3. Build Number Conflicts

**Problem:** App Store Connect rejected uploads with error:
```
The provided entity includes an attribute with a value that has already been used
```

**Cause:** Reusing the same build number (CFBundleVersion) across multiple uploads.

**Solution:** Use timestamp-based build numbers for automatic uniqueness.

```yaml
- name: Set bundle version
  script: |
    cd ios/App
    BUILD_NUMBER=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
    /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleVersion $BUILD_NUMBER" App/Info.plist
    agvtool new-version -all "$BUILD_NUMBER"
```

**Format:** `20260113143052` = January 13, 2026 at 14:30:52

**Benefits:**
- Always unique (unless builds run in same second, which is impossible on CI)
- Sortable chronologically
- No manual version management needed

---

### 4. App Icon Asset Catalog Requirements

**Problem:** Xcode error:
```
The app icon set "AppIcon" has 1 unassigned child
An app icon set must have exactly one "1024x1024" image for the "Any Appearance" image well
```

**Cause:** Incorrect metadata in `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json`

**Solution:** Ensure 1024x1024 icon has correct idiom:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "filename": "1024.png",
      "idiom": "ios-marketing",
      "scale": "1x",
      "size": "1024x1024"
    }
  ],
  "info": {
    "author": "xcode",
    "version": 1
  }
}
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- Must use `"idiom": "ios-marketing"` (NOT `"platform": "ios"`)
- File must be exactly 1024x1024 pixels PNG
- Required for "Any Appearance" image well
- No other platform keys should be present

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check image size
file ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/1024.png

# Check Contents.json format
cat ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json | jq '.images[] | select(.size == "1024x1024")'
```

### 5. RevenueCat Capacitor 8 Compatibility

**Problem:** RevenueCat UI package installation failed with peer dependency error:
```
@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor-ui requires capacitor@^7.0.0
```

**Cause:** RevenueCat UI package only supports Capacitor 7, not Capacitor 8.

**Solution:** Use base package only, not UI package.

```bash
# CORRECT (Capacitor 8)
npm install @revenuecat/purchases-capacitor@12.0.3

# WRONG (Capacitor 7 only)
npm install @revenuecat/purchases-capacitor-ui
```

**Version Compatibility:**
- `@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor@12.0.3+` → Capacitor 8
- `@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor@11.x.x` → Capacitor 7
- `@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor-ui` → Capacitor 7 only (no Capacitor 8 version)

---

### 6. Xcode Project Manual Signing Configuration

**Problem:** Code signing errors in CI despite correct workflow configuration.

**Cause:** Xcode project configured for automatic signing.

**Solution:** Set manual signing in Xcode project settings.

**Via Xcode GUI:**
1. Open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj`
2. Select App target
3. Go to Signing & Capabilities tab
4. Uncheck "Automatically manage signing"
5. Set Team to your Apple Developer team

**Verify in project.pbxproj:**
```
CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual;
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID;
```

Both Debug and Release configurations need these settings.

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Cannot save Signing Certificates without certificate private key"
→ Remove `ios_signing` block from environment section

### "provided entity includes an attribute with a value that has already been used"
→ Implement timestamp-based build numbers

### "The app icon set has 1 unassigned child"
→ Fix 1024x1024 icon idiom to `ios-marketing`

### "No matching profiles found"
→ Ensure bundle ID is registered and remove `ios_signing` block

### "unbound variable: FCI_CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY"
→ Use `${VAR:-}` syntax or remove `-u` from set command

### "@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor-ui requires capacitor@^7.0.0"
→ Use base package only: `@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor@12.0.3`

## Timeline of Fixes

This deployment required 5 major iterations:

1. **Initial attempt** - Failed on mixed signing (ios_signing block conflict)
2. **Second attempt** - Failed on certificate limit (generating new certs each time)
3. **Third attempt** - Failed on build number conflict (reusing same number)
4. **Fourth attempt** - Failed on app icon requirements (wrong idiom)
5. **Fifth attempt** - Success! All issues resolved

**Time saved for next deployment:** ~3-4 hours of debugging by following this guide.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Never use `ios_signing` block** when doing manual signing with `fetch-signing-files`
2. **One certificate per team** - Generate once, reuse forever
3. **Timestamp build numbers** - Simple, automatic, always unique
4. **Asset catalog metadata matters** - iOS is strict about icon format
5. **Capacitor 8 broke RevenueCat UI** - Use base package only
6. **Manual signing required on CI** - Set in Xcode project settings
